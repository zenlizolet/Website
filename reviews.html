            <h2>A Game of Thrones</h2>
            <p>Author: Matthew</p>
            <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
            <p>Review: I have finally done it! I have joined in on the fun that is A Game of Thrones. It is 2018 and I
                managed to make it all the way here without reading a page or watching a minute of the show. Now, it is
                the nature of the internet to keep me from being completely in the dark on this one, but I think I did a
                pretty good job of avoiding hearing or seeing too much about it.

                Is this a great fantasy book? It really is quite good. The plot and the characters are well thought out.
                Comparing it to other fantasy books I have read, it is right up there or better.

                Yeah, but since this has been taking the world by storm it must have blown your socks off!? Um, no, not
                really. It was good, but not, "OMG THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!" good.

                How about mainstream interest? So many people say they are not fantasy fans but they love this series.
                This has to be 95% because of the show. This book is SOOOOOOO fantasy, if it wasn't already popular I
                would never recommend it to anyone except a diehard fantasy fan. In fact, it isn't even really "fun"
                fantasy - it is dark with lots of politics and plotting. Some of my Goodreads friends said that
                historical fiction fans get a kick out of it, too, and it is loosely based on the War of the Roses.

                Do I want to watch the show now? Yeah, I think I will check it out.

                Sex and violence? I have seen some people wary of this book because of sex and violence. Internet
                spoilers, SNL skits, etc. sure do make it sound pretty vicious and risque. However, compared to other
                fantasy novels, it is pretty normal. In fact, the depiction of sex is pretty tame. Violence is maybe a
                little more intense, but nothing that made me feel the book was too extremely brutal. Perhaps these
                things get amped up in future books?

                EVERONE DIES! One thing that seemed to leak through the internet and my friends talking about the book
                was to not get too attached to a character because they will probably die. So far, only one death was
                kind of shocking to me. I expect the death count and the shock value to go up as the books progress.

                I think that covers the main points.
                - I liked it, but wasn't completely blown away.
                - I have no idea how HBO managed to get a bunch of non-fantasy fans into this.
                - I cannot wait to check out the next one to see what happens!</p>

            <h2>A Clash of Kings</h2>
            <p>Author: Madeline</p>
            <p>Rating: 3/5</p>
            <p>Review: "Kill your darlings" is a popular piece of advice given in creative writing classes - it's the
                concept that you shouldn't ever be afraid to take drastic and destructive action on your precious baby
                of a novel in order to move the plot forward or improve the story. George RR Martin should be held up as
                the gold standard of this rule, since his books might as well come labeled with a giant "Don't Get Too
                Attached" warning. It isn't just major and beloved characters (Eddard Stark, you will be avenged!) that
                get killed off in the space of a sentence; entire plots that have been building slowly for hundreds of
                pages are laid to waste with a single action so a new clusterfuck can get started.

                If Martin spent A Game of Thrones carefully constructing a miniature world and showing us around its
                various towns and characters, A Clash of Kings is when he suddenly starts stomping on everything and
                making Godzilla noises. Major characters aren't the only ones who get the axe (sometimes literally) here
                - towards the end of the book, one of the major setpieces of the story, a place whose geography I was
                just starting to understand, is burned to the ground and abandoned. Just like that.

                Even if these books aren't your particular cup of tea (and they happen to be my particular cup of crack
                cocaine), you have to admire Martin's ruthlessness when it comes to this world he's created. Nothing and
                no one is safe, which makes reading the books a delightfully tense experience - nothing is off limits
                here, and I look forward to seeing how far Martin can push things.

                (why only three stars, you might ask? Simply because this book, as I said in one of the comments,
                doesn't really have much of a plot, when you think about it. This book really feels like the second of a
                trilogy, which means it's mostly setting up events that will come around in the next installment. Still,
                I can't wait to see what Martin rebuilds in the wake of the destruction he wreaked in A Clash of Kings)

            <h2>A Storm of Swords</h2>
            <p>Author: Col</p>
            <p>Rating: 5/5</p>
            <p>
                I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews about this book: people complaining about a slow story line and a
                ridiculously cruel world where anyone can be killed off without a second thought. My response is: if you
                want a quick, happy clappy mushy book, you need to get yourself to the romance section. Or even better,
                the young adult section.

                My biggest pet peeve in books is feeling that characters are safe. I want people to die. I want people
                to be miserable. It tells me that the author is serious and that shit is going to get real. Sure, a
                happy moment every now and then would be nice, but the harsh realities in the world George Martin has
                created is a breath of fresh air. The character development is fantastic and I almost feel as if I've
                known these characters all my life. The story line can be slow at times, but that is what fantasy
                authors just tend to do, so get over it (LOTR, anyone?). Climactic events have me sitting on the
                proverbial edge of my seat because I know that it can go either way. Predictability has gone out the
                window, and although I like to believe I know where the story is going, George Martin proves time and
                time again that I just don't.

                Now let me stop waffling and get on with the next book!

            <h2>A Geast for Crows</h2>
            <p>Author: Mark Monday</p>
            <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
            <p>
                Behold: the Ugly Stepchild of A Song of Ice and Fire!
                Behold: the Readers of A Feast for Crows: Angry, Sullen, Vengeful!

                silly readers. i'm not sure i've ever read such a collection of resentful reviews for one book. one
                reviewer just decided to repeat the same phrase over and over and over again (sorry Joel, had to say
                it). another decided to note that "...kids are inherently boring. Kids aren’t clever..." er, wtf?

                sigh. i suppose i can understand the backlash. Martin took a long-assed time to put this out into the
                world and then - WHAT THE HELL - reader favorites Tyrion & Jon Snow & Daenerys have dropped off of this
                book's radar. but i am also perplexed - despite the loss of these wonderful creations, this is an
                excellent and challenging novel. come on readers, grow a pair!

                personally, i savored this book from beginning to end. the intricate plot, the propulsive narrative, the
                intelligent world-building, and most importantly the depth of characterization that were all hallmarks
                of prior volumes are still in place and undiminished in this installment. one of the things that is
                often overlooked about Martin is that he is a brilliant writer of quality prose. his descriptions are
                not just lavish, they are often quite beautiful. he has an expert grasp of language; the man knows how
                to create imagery that is by turns stark, subtly threatening, strangely enchanting, morbid, nostalgic,
                and ambiguous. the only reason the novel does not earn a top rating from me (but really, who cares
                anyway) is because of an unfortunately heavy reliance on repetition - mainly of key phrases and dream
                imagery. still, this novel should stand tall as an excellent continuation of this amazing series.

                first and foremost, A Feast for Crows is A Story of the Women of Westeros. because this is set in a
                medieval land that has very little wish fulfillment in terms of rectifying gender imbalance, it is fated
                by its own nature to be an unsettling and unfufilling narrative.

                CONSTANT SPOILERS FOLLOW

                The Queen Regent. Cersei Lannister is this series' chief villain and so it was with much anticipation
                that i approached her POV chapters. they did not disappoint. quite unlike the POV chapters from her
                formerly villainous twin Jaime, there is not much redemption coming Cersei's way. she's such a fuckin
                bitch, as the saying goes. she remains cold, grasping, machiavellian, murderous, and extremely petty.
                she is also incredibly entertaining: a villain in the Grand Old Style, full of swallowed rage and
                sweetly-uttered put-downs and viciously cruel schemes. she takes to drink and she lets a fellow viper
                into her bed (which also allows Martin to indulge in an enjoyably laugh out-loud lesbionic interlude).
                she makes a classic mistake in allowing fanatics to arm themselves. in the end, she literally outsmarts
                herself, and is the victim of her own foul trap. best of all, she is going crazy! her dreams haunt her,
                dreams of her death and the deaths of her children. much of her villainous nature is explained by these
                dreams...what mother wouldn't stop at anything to protect her children? and so Cersei doesn't stop at
                anything.

                but what i mainly took away from her chapters were two important lessons that i learned, oh, years ago,
                probably in my various college Gender Studies classes. first: a woman in power within a patriarchal
                structure is a woman in constant battle with her peers. she will not receive the automatic respect
                granted to men; she will have to "earn it", whatever that even means. she will be constantly reminded
                that her job is actually to marry and to bear children, and that her position of authority is somehow
                unnatural, against the natural order of things. i despised Cersei, but i also despised those around her
                who did not give her the automatic respect a man would have in her position. i appreciate that Martin
                made this inequity crystal clear: he is against Cersei (of course he is - she's the villain) but he also
                gives the challenges she faces in her new position a rather timeless quality. gender inequity is
                timeless.

                and the second lesson: a woman who gains power within a patriarchal system by mirroring the gender
                essentialism that supports that system has, sadly, sublimated that structure as natural and right - and
                will therefore enact that chauvinism. Women's Studies 101, folks. Cersei does not "challenge gender
                imbalance" - she supports it. her interior monologues are full of the same bullshit as any sexist
                dumbass. she despises "weakness" in men. she condemns "slutty" behavior while indulging in it herself.
                she uses classic chauvinistic tactics to bring down a rival and even-more-classic male brutality to
                destroy men and women alike. as i mentioned...she's a fuckin bitch! but her character is a fascinating
                one to contemplate.

                The Sand Snakes and The Dorne Princess. i suppose the chapters set in Dorne could contribute to many
                readers' disengagement with this novel. oh, whatever. i love Dorne! Dorne is the ugly stepchild of
                Westeros: matrilineal and distantly threatening, with a great big chip on its shoulder. but what a place
                it is: aggressive and volatile, sure, but also a land where women are automatically given the same
                respect as men, where a princess is the natural heir to the throne, where bastards are not automatically
                disrespected. the brief glimpses of the Sand Snakes, despite their inability to start the war they
                craved, were compelling in how differentiated they were in their various proposals to begin battle. and
                i also appreciated how fallible Arianne Martell turned out to be: a girl unused to schemes but still
                scheming away, a seductress who fell in love, a woman loyal to her friends and disinterested in cruelty,
                an heiress and misguided leader-to-be, one whose time in the limelight approaches.

                Sansa/Alayne and Arya/Cat. sometimes a girl has to literally convince herself that she is someone else,
                simply to survive. sometimes a girl has to forget the parts of her that make her herself, in order to
                achieve her goals. of course in one case, this is a girl who has lived her life as a pathos-ridden pawn.
                in the other case, we have a girl who is slowly losing her humanity as she becomes a kind of living
                weapon. eh, so what? they both have my full support. go Sansa & Arya, go! survive this series, you can
                do it!

                Catelyn/Stoneheart. and sometimes a woman fails. to accomplish her goals, to protect her loved ones, to
                save her children. i imagine that some women can get past this and can go on to define themselves anew.
                and other women cannot, or do not. they swallow their bitterness but do not forget: it becomes their
                fuel, their purpose for being. it can turn a heart to stone. and, um, it probably doesn't help having
                your throat slashed at your brother's wedding and then being revived as a monstrous quasi-zombie. and so
                Catelyn becomes a dread avenger, and not a pretty one. she is a killer without regard to reason or even
                justice, and she turns Dondarrion's Merry Men into a grim and bloodthirsty cabal. i never thought i'd
                see Thoros be so sad, so lost. i never thought Lemoncloak could be such an uncaring asshole. i never
                thought Catelyn would hang an innocent woman or a mere lad. well, i suppose that's what can happen. so i
                know that Brienne survives, that's obvious. but if Podric Payne dies, i'm coming after you, George
                Martin!

                The Maid of Tarth. i saved one of my favorite characters of the series for last. i don't think Brienne
                is a lot of readers' favorite; i assume they find her constant integrity and her equally constant
                naivete, repetitiousness, and lack of imagination to be tedious. but that's not how i feel! i loved her
                from beginning to (probably not her) end. there is such genuine realism to her loyal, awkward, lovelorn
                character. she is a warrior woman, but this means nothing in male-dominated Westeros except constant and
                automatic disrespect. she is, i suppose, "physically unattractive" and is constantly reminded of that by
                nearly every person she meets. she is always Doing The Right Thing; that integrity causes her to be
                disrespected even more, and it often means nothing to the people around her. well it means a lot to me!
                her quest may have been aimless, but it was also useful in illustrating the true and awful tragedy of
                war: the lives lost, the tormented survivors, the bleak landscapes, the sense of a world turned dark and
                bloody and soulless - a world without meaning. seeing such a brave person travel through this blighted
                landscape and continuously, stubbornly, mulishly trying to do good was hard to read - but it was also
                what i really needed in order to truly connect with this novel: a hero, tried and true. her two fight
                scenes, vanquishing members of the appalling Brave Companions, were awesome. what a brave lady and what
                a unique addition to the fantasy genre's Hero Archetype. i love her. as i loved this book.

                now on to the next one!

            <h2>A Dance with Dragons</h2>
            <p>Author: Mark Lawrence</p>
            <p>Rating: 5/5</p>
            <p>
                Released eleven years ago today!

                This is the review I did for the Sunday Express. It only appeared in hardcopy so I can't link it.

                Since it's a national newspaper and many of the readers may never have read a fantasy book, let alone
                the first four in the ASOIAF series, the review is less about this book and more about the series and
                the author. I hope to make them the gift of a great reading experience.

                My rating for the book is set in the context of the alternative works of fantasy on the shelves rather
                than in an attempt to rank this volume amongst its predecessors (I would say signficantly better than A
                Feast For Crows - less good than the first three, still excellent)


                [Sunday Express review]

                By the time you reach the end of George Martin’s A Dance with Dragons you will be nearly two million
                words into A Song of Ice and Fire, a sprawling epic fantasy series that is for many readers the single
                most defining work in the genre for a generation. A Dance with Dragons is itself over four hundred
                thousand words (one thousand printed pages), not that far shy of the whole of The Lord of the Rings or
                War and Peace - not that literary worth is measured on weighing scales.

                Martin’s series, starting with A Game of Thrones, has been a slow-burning phenomenon, dwarfed only by
                the colossus that is Harry Potter. Right now all the volumes are on the Amazon top twenty list. When A
                Dance With Dragons was released in hardback last month it immediately became the fastest-selling fiction
                hardback this year in the UK.

                It has probably been the most anticipated (adult) fantasy novel ever published, helped of course by the
                recent excellent serialisation of the first book by HBO. A significant contribution to the anticipation
                has been the six-year wait since the last book, a source of controversy and teeth grinding amongst the
                readership. Internet grumbling about the delay reached such a pitch it prompted Neil Gaiman to blog to
                fans: ‘George Martin is not your bitch’. Whilst the books may roll out of the printing house on a
                conveyor belt, the words themselves cannot simply be squeezed out of the author by mounting pressure!

                So, has it been worth the six year wait? There was a five-year wait for book four, A Feast for Crows,
                and many fans felt the novel didn’t fulfill the promise of the first three, making the critical success
                of book five the focus of still more intense speculation.

                Martin’s success stands on the simple fact that he has brought to the fantasy genre the mature skills of
                realism, characterisation, and observation more commonly associated with literary fiction, and married
                them to a vivid and endless imagination. His commercial success derives from the fact that the books are
                addictively enjoyable.

                You don’t need to be a reader of fantasy to enjoy Martin’s work. Martin writes primarily about people.
                You will have fallen in love with, or at least be fascinated by, his characters long before you see your
                first dragon. By that point you’ll believe in the dragon because you believe in the people through whose
                eyes you see it.

                A Dance with Dragons advances the story with more purpose and scope than its predecessor, reacquainting
                us with favourite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Dany, and Bran) we’ve not seen since A Storm of Swords
                (2000). The story ranges across thousands of miles from icy wastes to dusty desert, expanding the
                incredible diversity of Martin’s world, showing stories on the small scale (Arya’s training) and the
                grand (Daenerys’ realpolitik). And although the 1000 pages meander through many lives and situations,
                there are hints at the ultimate convergence and conflict of disparate story threads, a slow building
                sense of momentum, and finally a rising tension and pace that drives us breathless to the edge of
                several cliffs.

                One quote that stuck with me is “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads
                lives only one.” And George Martin offers you a fair portion of those thousand right here.

                Turning the final page you can only be disappointed . . . to find it is the last, and you’ll immediately
                want to reach for the next volume. And there maybe lies the rub.
