        <section class="introtekst">

            <p> Game of Thrones, based on the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin, is set in
                a medieval-inspired world primarily on the continents of Westeros and Essos. <br>
                The story is set in a time period reminiscent of the Middle Ages, featuring a blend of fantasy
                elements such as dragons, magic, and supernatural beings, alongside realistic political intrigue,
                warfare, and societal structures. <br>
                Westeros, where much of the action takes place, is divided into several regions, each ruled by noble
                houses vying for power and control. <br>
                The series begins at a time of relative stability, following the long summer season, but tensions
                rise rapidly as various factions vie for control of the Iron Throne, the seat of power in the Seven
                Kingdoms.</p>
