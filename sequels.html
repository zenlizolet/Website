            <h2>About the Series</h2>
            <p>Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where
                summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the
                frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective
                Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious
                circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie
                the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now
                Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens
                to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.

                    Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms
                    that
                    owe
                    allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of
                    Winterfell
                    rules in
                    Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his
                    sons
                    Robb,
                    Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the
                    north,
                    behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth
                    during the
                    centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the
                    season.

                    Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has
                    died
                    under
                    mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the
                    lovely but
                    cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime
                    and
                    Tyrion
                    of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second
                    a
                    dwarf
                    whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful
                    encounter
                    that will change the course of kingdoms.

                    Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which
                    once
                    ruled
                    all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose
                    loyalty
                    he will
                    purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.

            <section class="Summary">

                <p> In this eagerly awaited sequel to A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin has created a work
                    of
                    unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination. A Clash of Kings transports us to a world of
                    revelry
                    and
                    revenge, wizardry and warfare unlike any you have ever experienced.

                    A CLASH OF KINGS

                    A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. And from the ancient citadel of
                    Dragonstone to
                    the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a
                    divided land
                    and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest,
                    turmoil, and
                    war. It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the
                    night.
                    Here a
                    princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a
                    treacherous
                    sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside.
                    Against a
                    backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women
                    possessed of
                    the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.

            <section class="Summary">

                <p>The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry
                    beast.
                    Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone
                    wasteland
                    of
                    the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards
                    the
                    Wall.

                    The men of the Night’s Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking
                    corpses
                    that
                    travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong – hungry
                    savage
                    people
                    steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness – poised to invade the Kingdom of the
                    North
                    where
                    Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown.

                    But Robb’s defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark’s
                    enemies
                    the
                    Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the
                    Lannister
                    boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. Cersei’s ambition
                    is
                    unfettered while the dwarf Tyrion Lannister fights for his life, a victim of treachery.

                    And on the other side of the ocean, the last of the Targaryens rears the dragons she hatched
                    from
                    her
                    husband’s funeral pyre. Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge
                    the
                    murder
                    of
                    her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.

                <p> The future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance.

                    In the east, Daenerys, last scion of House Targaryen, her dragons grown to terrifying
                    maturity,
                    rules as
                    queen of a city built on dust and death, beset by enemies.

                    Now that her whereabouts are known many are seeking Daenerys and her dragons. Among them the
                    dwarf,
                    Tyrion Lannister, who has escaped King’s Landing with a price on his head, wrongfully
                    condemned
                    to
                    death
                    for the murder of his nephew, King Joffrey. But not before killing his hated father, Lord
                    Tywin.

                    To the north lies the great Wall of ice and stone – a structure only as strong as those
                    guarding
                    it.
                    Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow has been elected the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's
                    Watch,
                    but
                    he has enemies both in the Watch and beyond the Wall, where the wildling armies are massing
                    for
                    an
                    assault.

                    On all sides bitter conflicts are reigniting, played out by a grand cast of outlaws and
                    priests,
                    soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves. The tides of destiny will inevitably lead to
                    the
                    greatest
                    dance of all…

                <p>Daniel Abraham's adaptation of George R. R. Martin's acclaimed epic fantasy A Game of Thrones
                    continues
                    to cast its gripping spell. In the savage north, Jon Snow finds new friends-and
                    enemies-among
                    the
                    brothers of the Night's Watch, sworn to defend Westeros against the horrors that lie beyond
                    the
                    Wall. In
                    the more civilized savagery of King's Landing, Eddard Stark learns from Catelyn of the
                    Lannisters'
                    involvement in the attack on Bran . . . and the murder of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of
                    the
                    King.
                    While across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys-newly wed to Khal Drogo-learns what it means to be a
                    khaleesi
                    of
                    the Dothraki. A Game of Thrones #1 was everything I could ever want in an adaptation...and
                    more." -
                    Geeks of Doom "The art is wonderful to look at with all the detail contained in each panel,
                    and
                    I'm
                    willing to give this series more of my time. I think fans of the book and television series
                    will
                    enjoy
                    this condensed read." - Major Spoilers "If you are a fan of the novel, this will be a fun
                    graphic
                    adaptation with nice line-work." - Weekly Comic Book Review "With so much excitement to come
                    in
                    the
                    series, now is a perfect time to pick up A Game of Thrones." - Broken Frontier
